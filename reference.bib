abstract="This chapter provides a friendly introduction to the analysis of optimization problems constrained by complementarity and other optimization problems. These problems are also known as bilevel problems [3], and the field of study to which they belong, hierarchical optimization. Throughout this chapter, we refer to them using the acronym OPcOPs, Optimization Problems constrained by other Optimization Problems, which explicitly indicates a hierarchy.",
